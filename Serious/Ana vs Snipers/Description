For three players. Ana can't use her gun, but her sleep dart cooldown is reduced to 2.16 seconds, and she can only be damaged by headshots. Health packs are enabled but respawn very slowly and do 20% less healing. The other team spawn with their ultimate available, but it probably won't help that much. First to three wins.
